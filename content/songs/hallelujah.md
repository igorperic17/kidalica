Capo 1

C Am F G
C Am F G

I heard there was a secret chord that David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?

C Am F G
C Am F G

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah

C Am F G
C Am F G

Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
