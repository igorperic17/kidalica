Capo 2

Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4
Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do

Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4
Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4
Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4

Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt

Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4
Em7 G Dsus4 A7sus4

I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
